== Installation hints for Mac ==
You can run LookSeq under the native Mac web server. XAMPP and the like might work as well (not tested).

You will need to install some software, though. First, get the GD library from http://libgd.org
Install that through the usual ./configure ; make ; sudo make install
Then get the Perl GD module : sudo cpan install GD
Then get the Perl GD::Image module : sudo cpan install GD::Image
Then get the Perl SQLite module : sudo cpan install DBD::SQLite

You might have to comment out some "use" statements for Sanger modules in LookSeq files; we are working on fixing that bug.
